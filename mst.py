MINIMUM SPANNING TREE (MST) ALGORITHMS THEORY:

A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph 
that connects all the vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

1. KRUSKAL'S ALGORITHM:
   Kruskal's algorithm builds the MST by adding edges in order of increasing weight, 
   skipping edges that would create a cycle.
   
   Steps:
   1. Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of weight
   2. Pick the smallest edge that doesn't form a cycle with the MST formed so far
   3. Repeat step 2 until there are (V-1) edges in the MST
   
   Key characteristics:
   - Uses a disjoint-set data structure (Union-Find) to detect cycles
   - Follows a greedy approach
   - Time Complexity: O(E log E) or O(E log V) for sorting edges
   - Space Complexity: O(E + V)

2. PRIM'S ALGORITHM:
   Prim's algorithm builds the MST by starting from a random vertex and 
   greedily adding the lowest weight edge that connects a vertex in the tree 
   to a vertex outside the tree.
   
   Steps:
   1. Start with a single vertex
   2. Add the minimum weight edge from tree vertices to non-tree vertices
   3. Repeat until all vertices are included
   
   Key characteristics:
   - Often implemented with a priority queue
   - Follows a greedy approach
   - Time Complexity: O(VÂ²) with adjacency matrix, O(E log V) with binary heap
   - Space Complexity: O(V)

3. Comparison:
   - Kruskal's works well for sparse graphs (fewer edges)
   - Prim's works better for dense graphs (many edges)
   - Both guarantee an optimal MST for undirected graphs

4. Applications of MST:
   - Network design (telephone, electrical, hydraulic, TV cable, computer, road)
   - Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems (Traveling Salesman Problem)
   - Cluster analysis
   - Image segmentation
   - Handwriting recognition
